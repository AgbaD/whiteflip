To create a fixed width layout,
the width of the main boxes on
a page will usually be specified
in pixels (and sometimes their
height, too).
Here you can see several <div>
elements, each of which uses an
id or class attribute to indicate
its purpose on the page.
In a book like this, the result of
both the fixed and liquid layouts
look similar. To get a real feel for
them, you need to view them in
your browser and see how they
react when you adjust the size of
the browser window.
